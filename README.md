# Embedding-Based Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a recommendation system using embeddings learned through a neural network. The system identifies similar courses based on user input, such as a course name or topic, without relying on predictive models. It uses cosine similarity to return courses closest to the user's input in the learned embedding space.

## Features
- Learns embeddings for courses based on their features (e.g., category, subcategory, price, etc.).
- Uses cosine similarity to measure and rank similarity between courses.
- Provides recommendations based on semantic similarity without predicting a specific target variable.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow
  - NumPy
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
